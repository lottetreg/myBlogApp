# Overview
This simple app demonstrates how you can use Matcha to build a CRUD app. At this point in time, Matcha only provides the "CR" (create and read) functionality. Matcha also only currently allows for reading from and writing to CSV files, as opposed to using a proper database.

myBlogApp allows users to create and view blog posts. They can also create and view comments for each blog post.

Please visit the [Match repository](https://github.com/lottetreg/matcha) for instructions.
